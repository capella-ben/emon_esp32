# emon_esp32
Implementaion of emonlib for esp32 using the Adruino toolchain.

This is a basic copy of the calcIrms function from emonlib.  I had to do this because there was no way to easily set the ADC bits using the emonlib.

I also found that not all the ESP32 ADC's behave the same.

This is a work in progress.
